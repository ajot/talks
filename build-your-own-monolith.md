# Build Your Own Little Monolith: Everyday Automation with Python

Not every project needs a microservice. For personal automation, a little monolith is often all you need. Over the past year, I built what I call the **Simple Butler Service** —a Flask-based monolith that automates the everyday tasks that make my life easier.
