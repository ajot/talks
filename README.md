# Talks

A collection of my CFPs, blurbs, and talk ideas. These are the topics I’ve spoken about (or plan to!) at conferences and meetups.

## What’s Inside
- Polished talk proposals.
- Ideas I’ve turned into engaging sessions.
- Inspiration for future talks.

## Why This Exists
To keep everything in one place and make it easy to share and reuse.
